Mini Project 1 for Single-Cell Biology: Identifying the Regenerative Organizing Cell (ROC) in the Frog Tail
**Course:** Single-Cell Biology  
**Author:** Chi Zhang (cz2925@columbia.edu)  
**Repository:** Public for submission  
**Goal:** Identify the Regenerative Organizing Cell (ROC) in the *Xenopus* tail using clustering and marker gene analysis.

---

## Abstract
We identify the regenerative organizing cell population in the frog tail through single-cell transcriptomic clustering and gene marker comparison with Supplementary Table 3 from [1].

---

## Methods
1. Data preprocessing and normalization using Scanpy.  
2. Dimensionality reduction (PCA, UMAP, t-SNE).  
3. Clustering with Louvain and Leiden algorithms.  
4. Marker gene selection using logistic regression and differential expression analysis.  
5. Comparison with known ROC markers.  

---

## Results
- Two major ROC-like clusters identified.  
- Marker genes overlap with *wnt5a*, *fgf8*, and *msx1* from Table 3.  
- Denoising and batch integration improved silhouette score by 12%.
