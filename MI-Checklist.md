## üß© Part 1. Study Design

| Requirement | Completed | Notes |
|--------------|------------|-------|
| The biological problem is clearly detailed in the paper. | Yes | ROC identification during *Xenopus* tail regeneration. |
| The research question is clearly stated. | Yes | Determine which clusters represent ROC-like populations. |
| The characteristics of datasets (training/test sets) are detailed. | Yes | scRNA-seq dataset from *Aztekin et al.*, 2019 (*Science*). |
| Cohorts are representative of the biological system. | Yes | Includes skin, muscle, and notochord cells from regenerative tissue. |
| Baseline comparison identified and detailed. | Yes | Compared to published ROC markers in Supplementary Table 3. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Part 2‚Äì3. Data and Optimization

| Requirement | Completed | Notes |
|--------------|------------|-------|
| Data origin and format described. | Yes | Public dataset from *Science* (2019) and EBI repository. |
| Transformations of the data before model application are described. | Yes | Log normalization, scaling, HVG selection, PCA (50 PCs). |
| Details of evaluated models provided. | Yes | Louvain vs Leiden clustering compared. |

## üìà Part 4. Model Performance

| Requirement | Completed | Notes |
|--------------|------------|-------|
| Primary evaluation metric clearly stated. | Yes | Silhouette score ‚âà 0.51 (BBKNN), 0.37 (Scanorama). |
| Clinical utility metric stated. | N/A | Non-clinical biological dataset. |
| Performance comparison between baseline and model shown. | Yes | ARI ‚âà 0.81‚Äì0.87; Leiden preserved structure better than Louvain. |

## üîç Part 5. Model Examination

| Requirement | Completed | Notes |
|--------------|------------|-------|

| Examination technique 2 (e.g., visualization). | Yes | UMAP colored by ROC markers (egfl6, nid2, pltp). |
| Discussion of result relevance. | Yes | ROC markers align with cluster 19 expression patterns. |
| Discussion of interpretability. | Yes | Marker-based interpretation allows clear biological insight. |
| Discussion of robustness. | Yes | Cluster topology consistent after batch correction (Scanorama & BBKNN). |
